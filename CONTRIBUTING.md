### Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs and feature requests. Before submitting a new issue, please check to make sure a similar issue isn't already open. If one is, contribute to that issue thread with additional information or solutions. If none exists, feel free to open a new issue.

- **Bug Reports**: Provide as much information as possible, such as how to reproduce the bug and the error message.
  
- **Feature Requests**: If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist, you're probably not alone. Open an issue to request the feature.

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the main ScrapeMind repository and clone your fork locally.
2. **Create a New Branch**: For each new feature or bugfix, create a separate branch.
3. **Commit Your Changes**: Write a good commit message.
4. **Push to Your Fork**: And submit a pull request against the ScrapeMind `main` branch.
